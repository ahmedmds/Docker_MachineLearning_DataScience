# --rm tells Docker daemon to clean up the container and remove it from file system once container is stopped, minimizes computational resources
# nginx is the image, pulled from library/nginx if not available locally
# This command starts the container
...\NGINX>docker run -it --rm -d -p 8080:8080 --name test_automation nginx

# To go to interactive mode of running container
Use Docker dashboard UI
# html folder containing index.html located in
/usr/share/nginx/html

Create index.html file in local folder directory

Create Dockerfile in local folder directory
# In this Dockerfile:
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
# In this way the local content can be taken and moved to the directory of the container

# Build image
...\NGINX>docker build -t testauto:v1 .

# Run container
...\NGINX>docker run -d -p 80:80 testauto:v1

# Check deployment of newly created index.html
http://localhost:80/

# However, the test_automation container of nginx image will have original index.html of nginx
http://localhost:8080/
